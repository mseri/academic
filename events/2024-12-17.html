      <p><em>Visualizing mathematical concepts with sketchnotes and comics</em></p>
      <p>Abstract: In this talk I share my experience, as a mathematician and illustrator, doing maths communication using two graphic formats: sketchnotes and comics. They're both visual languages to express ideas, which from my point of view, makes them similar to the mathematical language. While sketchnotes are immediate by nature and concern more ideas and their structure, comics allow for storytelling and context. In my work the dividing line between these two formats blurs, to adapt to mathematical content. Sketchnotes, or visual note-taking, is a way of recording thoughts using drawings, symbols, and text following a certain structure or hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Sketchnotes, and its live version "graphic recording", has had quite a boom in the past decade thanks to the work of Mike Rohde, UX designer and sketchnote expert. In recent years I've explored the possibilities of using this format to communicate math and to teach. In this talk I report on the #Noethember and #mathyear initiatives and the book La Gran Aventura del Conocimiento (Ed. Planeta Chile, 2023) written with mathematician and didactician Leslie Jimenez Palma (U. Chile).</p>
      <p>Together with sketchnotes, I've explored more recently the format of comics and zines to do outreach. I report on a recent collaboration with mathematician Alberto Mercado (U. Federico Santa Maria,Chile) a comic about the Collatz Conjecture, available at www.acip.cl/comic/</p>

      <p><em>A collection of "proofs" for the importance of Illustration for Mathematical Research</em></p>
      <p>Abstract: Mathematical understanding is built in many ways. Among these, illustration has been a companion and tool for research for as long as research has taken place. We use the term illustration to encompass any way one might bring a mathematical idea into physical form or experience, including hand-made diagrams or models, computer visualization, 3D printing, and virtual reality, among many others. In the talk, we will provide several "proofs" for the importance of illustrations for mathematical research. Among these will be a proof by authority, reference, example, picture, and curiosity, respectively. The talk will end with some pointers how to start illustrating your own mathematics.</p>
