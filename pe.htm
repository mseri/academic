                        you haven't already done it! Every month, we interview
                        mathematicians to talk about mathematics and the
                        stereotypes and biases that come with it. We hope to
                        demistify some of them by showing the human side of
                        mathematics and by discussing what the life of

                <h4 style="margin-top: 15px" id="oscillations">Oscillations book</h4>
                <p>This book is an introduction to the mathematics of oscillations, useful as a general introduction to dynamical systems and hamiltonian mechanics. The main difference from most other textbooks on the subject is that the main body of the book, only uses basic knowledge of calculus and trigonometry, and as such should be suitable for young bachelor students. Similarly, the first three appendices and the solutions to the exercises are also meant to be accessible, even if slightly more advanced.
                The other appendices, instead, are aimed at curious readers who let themselves be provoked by new ideas. In particular we think of more advanced students and their teachers. For mathematical background we often refer to the extensive bibliography.</p>
                <p>
                The book is still in draft form, and we are looking for feedback from the readers. You can download the book in PDF format by clicking on the link below.</p>

                    Aperiodic monotiles have been discovered in 2023 and

                    An entertaining and educational introduction to what they are and the mathematics behind them can be found on Scientific Amarican, in an article from one of the discoverers themselves: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/inside-mathematicians-search-for-the-mysterious-einstein-tile/">Inside Mathematicians’ Search for the Mysterious ‘Einstein Tile’</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This activity is a hands-on workshop where participants play with the monotiles to construct a super-tile. We use two cutely decorated and coloured tiles (the bright turtles in the photo below) as references to follow our bluperints and let the participant draw what they want on the other tiles.
                  In this way, the activity remains accessible to all ages and backgrounds, and provides a playful way to introduce the concept of aperiodic tiling to a broad audience.
                  Outside the room, we also had a laser cutter constantly producing new tiles, allowing the participants to experience the whole process, from cutting the paper to the wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each personalized supertile was assembled in a super-super tile on a table nearby. The participants came with us and decide where they want their tile to be located, following our blueprint. Once the super-super tile is ready, we move it to the wall, where it contributes to the final super-super-super tile on the wall.

                />
                With 5 hours and the help of hundreds of participants, we
                covered a wall patch of 657 artistic spectre tiles! This was a full super-super-super tile, an additional super-super tile and a few extra super tiles. One group did create a super tile by flipping two of the tiles, can you spot it on the photo? We decided to keep it as it was, as it was a nice touch to the final result.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The activity was very fun and engaging, and we received a lot of positive feedback from the participants. It was nice to see people coming back at the end of the day to see where their artworks ended up on the wall, and take pictures with it.

                    In the same spirit of the original discoverers of the monotiles, we decided to release all of our materials for free use under the same
